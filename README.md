# Triangle Dot Click Game

## General Assembly Web Development Immersive Project 1

### Technologies Used:
- JavaScript (ES6)
- HTML5
- SCSS3
- JQuery

### Game Instructions:

You have 30 seconds to get as many points as possible each round. Every element on the screen is worth certain points. The element with the highest point value is the small teal dot, worth +7 points. Next is the smallest triangles, each worth +3 points. The medium sized triangles are worth +2 points and the largest triangles are worth +1 point. Play with your friends, and see who can get the highest score, so far the top is 79 points! :) Hope you have fun playing!

- Small Triangle = +3 points
- Medium Triangle = +2 points
- Large Triangle = +1 point
- Dot = +7 points


### Development Approach:

When I started brainstorming for this project, I knew I wanted to build a game primarily with JavaScript, utilizing the new ES6 features like let/const, and ‘fat-arrow’. I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to practice using multiple classes, constructors, and iterating through objects. I also wanted to add vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation, some interesting game logic, and animations using jQuery and SCSS, plus some bright fun moving colors!

I started by white-boarding my ideas and researching the code I would need. Then I set up the three separate Play, Game, and Dot classes and wrote out the methods I thought I would need. I wrote copious comments, describing what I wanted to do with each method and how they should interact with one another. Then I started writing the code!

Initially the game was more focused on colors and each of the elements to click were circles or ‘dots’! This was visually appealing but after thinking more and playing the game, I decided to change the ‘dots’ into triangles, in order to have more animated features like rotations. I also pivoted away from clicking dots in a set color sequence, to instead clicking dots based on size. I am very happy with the current state of the game, and would love to continue adding additional features in the future.
